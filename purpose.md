# Purpose

Almost all of us have some kind of goals. We work or worked very hard
for that. But for whatever reason, if you loosing that purpose, it's time
to rethink. You may say "Come on! It's all over. I am done." or "One day I'll 
die, so what's the point?" or "Lonliness has overcomed me". But let's think 
critically for a moment. You are saying it's over because maybe you are just
tired, lost hope. Whether you succeed or not you will die. And lonliness just
disturbing you a bit in you success. Think about it, you life is indeed very 
boring right now. And you are choosing not to do anything. Wouldn't it be better
if you make plan, make promise to yourself about making your life better.
Make you jouney of life exciting. It will give your life meaning. And it is
better than doing nothing. And maybe you will acheive more than you imagine or
you can ever imagine.
