# Purpose

The secret to a meaningful life is simple. Find a purpose and struggle hard to achieve it.
Having dreams, goals and aspirations is very important for us. Without a proper vision of what
we want to be, we cannot move forward. 

So, the first step should be to find out what is your purpose in life.

Now that we have a goal, we should be working very hard to achieve that.
But for whatever reason, if you loosing that purpose, it's time
to rethink. You may say "Come on! It's all over. I am done." or "One day I'll 
die, so what's the point?" or "Lonliness has overcomed me". But let's think 
critically for a moment. You are saying it's over because maybe you are just
tired, lost hope. Whether you succeed or not you will die. And lonliness just
disturbing you a bit in you success. Think about it, you life is indeed very 
boring right now. And you are choosing not to do anything. Wouldn't it be better
if you make plan, make promise to yourself about making your life better.
Make you jouney of life exciting. It will give your life meaning. And it is
better than doing nothing. And maybe you will acheive more than you imagine or
you can ever imagine.
