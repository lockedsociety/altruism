# Choices and their Consequences

Whenever we want to watch reels, tiktok, play games etc of this 
kind, you have two choices; either we do it or  we don't. At this 
very moment we have to remind ourselves of the consquences of the choice
that we will make. If we choose to pursue our goal it will benefit us.
If we choose not to, then well, we are in the same destructive loop. We
have to break out of that loop. With strong mindset, with a clear vision
and with a strong will we can change this destructive habit.
