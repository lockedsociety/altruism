# Altruism

The escape from the rotten reality.

The question that might come to your mind is, what is this rotten reality. Well have a look around yourself. To put it in words, I would quote a dialogue from the movie 
[Fight Club.](https://www.google.com/search?q=fight+club&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN1013IN1013&oq=fight+club+&aqs=chrome.0.0i271j46i67i131i433j0i67i131i433l2j46i67i433j0i67i433j0i512j69i60.1463j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
> "Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war’s a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pi\*\*ed off."

This initiative is for people, and men who feel lost in today's wordly norms. With so much negativity sorrounding the term 'masculinity', such as the term 'toxic masculinity', we are here to guide you towards your own journey of being masculine. But, what exactly is masculinity? According to Google this is masculinity.
>qualities or attributes regarded as characteristic of men.
>
>"handsome, muscled, and driven, he's a prime example of masculinity"

So, does this mean, having a good physics with a handsome face makes you masculine? To some extent, it is true. But, the times have changed. Masculinity is not just about having a good physique, but also about having courage, having mental strength to overcome adversities, not giving in to the temptations of the modern world etc. But that does not mean, we are discouraging people to work on their physique. We are not. Exercising, going to the gym, running are all noble practises and they are an extremely important part of being a complete man. A man, who is strong mentally and physically, who is using his strengths to overcome adversities to reach his goals is who we should strive to become.

Now that I have your attention, lets get started !
